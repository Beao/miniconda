This repo is used with gitpod to set up a working environment for jupyterlab. It does the following
1. Create a base conda environment (using miniconda)
2. Provide a script to create a new conda environment. Also install essential packages for running a jupyterlab instance

How to use:
Once the gitpod completes with building the environment, just run ./envconfig.sh in /workspace/miniconda.
